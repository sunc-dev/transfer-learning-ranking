They, like Nate, had just been back from the one-year-war, and they needed some rest. With their girlfriends.    The war had ended - a short but cruel war. My boyfriend, Nate, was meant to be back from the army a week ago. I'd been questioning his friends about the delay, but they said it was just 'army traffic'.    Except I couldn't relax.

Well I guess that’s what I get for falling asleep in front of three Peters girls, I should have known better! “You’d better run!” I shouted, streaking after one of them at random. It turned out to be Lisa so I smiled and pushed myself after her, making her scream at my mom for help, “Mom! Make him leave me alone!”  The...\n",
              "562  “You know most girls would be mad that they were thrown into a muddy lake.” Kyle said when I came up.   “No I'm not.” I protested .  “One day I will make you realize that you are better than you think, but until then will you have dinner with me and my family?” He said shaking his head.  “Of course Big Bad Alpha.” I jokingly answered.  “I'll show you big and bad. Hold your breath.” Ky sad picking me up and throwing me across the lake. I came up laughing .  “Well if you two love birds are done I'm starving.” I hear from the left of me. I didn't even have to look to know it was Miles. I looked over Kyle's shoulder to see Miles standing there uninjured beside his arm in a sling. Miles must have saw me looking at it and said, “Don't worry it will be healed by the morning,” Miles always knew how to reassure me.  “Lets go eat dinner.” Kyle said letting me jump on his back. As we got out of the lake Miles handed us a towel and we walked back inside to eat dinner.   Sitting at the table wa...\n",
              "690  Right? I said. \"Well, we were together this weekend,\" she smiled,\"AndyouknowIreallylikehim!\" she said so fast that her words were all jumbled.. I rolled my eyes and ignored what she just said. He used her the first time, what makes her think he is going to change this time? I really hope she knows what she is doing. \"Say something!\" she frowned. \"Something!\" I said flatly. I shouldn't be mad at her, it is her choice and she can do whatever she wants to do. \"Seriously,\" she sighed,\"You are my best friend and you should be happy with whatever decision I make!\" she pouted. That face doesn't work anymore, but she is right. \"Fine, you're right!\" I sighed,\"Just be careful!\" I warned. She has no idea what she is getting herself into. Speaking of the devil, Kyle and his buddies were heading our way. ~ \"Why are you always so early to class?\" I heard from behind me. I smiled at the sound of his voice. Ethan pushed the door shut, stopping me from entering. \"The only way you would know that is...\n",
              "729  Any guys? he asked, this time looking clearly amused. \"Nothing really...there's some good book stores around I like to go to\" I say, not glancing up once to see the smug look on his face. I continued to move around my food, mixing the scrambled eggs with the ketchup. \"I'm done\" he stated to both of us and slammed the door shut, leaving Gwen and I all alone. \"I'm going out\" I said standing from the kitchen table. I grabbed my bag from the coat rack. \"So what have you been up to these past 7 months?\" he questioned pointing his spoon in my direction. \"Must be!\" my sister said scooping her scrambled eggs in a heap and bringing it to her mouth. \"It felt pretty amazing, you know there was a rush of adrenaline but the feeling of knowing you might not come back alive is...a bit scary.\" \"Your dying one minute at a time\" continued to play through my head during the entire night and throughout breakfast. He talked about his experience in Afghanistan for what seemed like hours but his previous...\n",
              "831  HEY GUYS!!! Ok, this is my first book and I'm really just experimenting.. I don't know how often I will add more and where this book is going, I'm just going to type until I've finished it. it would be great if i could get feed back from you all! ;) hope you enjoy it! Chapter One- Goodbye AustraliaI flew my eyes open, allowing them to search around my once quiet room. 'BANG!' There it was again. My eyes darted left to right until they fell upon my door where I saw two paws shadowing at the crack of the bottom of it. I felt relief flood into me as I realised it was only TP. I rolled over and saw the sun streaming through the cracks of my dust covered blinds, it looked so warm like a perfect summers day, although I knew that was too good to be true. I then looked down and stared at my favourite purple suitcase that lay there unzipped on my messy floor, with all it's contents spilling out. \"Today's the day.\" I thought out loud. I was going to boarding school. I have been dreading this...\n",
              "878  Breakfast in bed, ma announced the obvious. \"Oh, we do spoil you.\"    Ma pushed open the door with a tray, singing happy birthday. I knew dad was getting my present from downstairs. Lindsay had come home from college specially to celebrate my birthday.    Nate was the only one not home. I had planned our reunion for god knows how long, and he had gone and spoilt it.    I had a feeling they were all keeping something from me. But I didn't say any more. They, like Nate, had just been back from the one-year-war, and they needed some rest. With their girlfriends.    The war had ended - a short but cruel war. My boyfriend, Nate, was meant to be back from the army a week ago. I'd been questioning his friends about the delay, but they said it was just 'army traffic'.    Except I couldn't relax.    Se-ven-teen. I tasted the word on my tongue. It was the age between two milestones - sixteen and eighteen. Wedging itself in between the two most important ages. I was glad it was there because,..."
